            we'll
            provide an overview of what <span>Join</span> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.</p>
        <h2 class="second-headline">What is Join?</h2>
        <div class="help-main-span">
            <p class=""><span>Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of
                dedicated
                students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>
            <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span>Join</span> leverages the principles of
                kanban to help
                users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that <span>Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended
                for
                extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot

                    <span>Exploring the Board</span>
                    <p>When you log in to <span>Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your
                        project and contains
                        four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>

                    <span>Creating Contacts</span>
                    <p>In <span>Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts"
                        section, click on
                        "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
                        tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>

                    <span>Adding Cards</span>
                    <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                        tasks.
                        Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details
                        in
                        the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>

                    <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                        dropping the card from one list to another.</p>

                    <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card
                        will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
                        action is irreversible.</p> <br>
                    <p>Remember that using <span>Join</span> effectively requires consistent updates from you and your
                        team
                        to ensure the
                        board reflects the current state of your project.</p> <br>
